# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Task-1-Codsoft-
Codsoft Task 1 This project focuses on predicting passenger survival from the Titanic dataset using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to build a classification model that can determine whether a passenger survived based on features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and family size.
